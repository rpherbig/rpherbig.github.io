A wild blog has appeared!

I've considered blogging for a while now, but somehow I never quite got around to it. Other things always took priority. There was always something else to do. I've given it some thought and found what will motivate me to start blogging (I'll write about that too).

For now, I'm going to start with a few posts on how to get a simple blog up and running. This is my first time doing this, so it has been (and is being) a good learning opportunity, as well as producing something useful.

The tech stack I started with is GitHub Pages and Jekyll. A bit later I added in Google Domains for a personalized domain. I'm writing and running Jekyll locally on a Windows machine before deploying to GitHub Pages. I expected this to go smoothly since this seemed like a fairly typical tech stack using popular choices for each component, and the two main platforms (GitHub Pages and Jekyll) are designed to work together.

Spoiler alert: it's harder than it should be.
