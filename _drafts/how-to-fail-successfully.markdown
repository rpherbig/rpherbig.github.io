How to Fail Successfully
OR
How to Succeed By Failing


I saw this recently in a blog post:
<<<<<
Take no action on failure other than to ask what was learned 
When a team fails in a particular area I often say the following: 
“I do not care who did it. Have we learned why it happened? Have we taken steps to see that it does not happen again?”
By always leading with the “I do not care who did it” you establish a safe failure zone. The individual knows that he will not “get in trouble” for his failure. The team knows that they are supported. 
Celebrate the failure as a learning opportunity. 
>>>>>


It is critical that the team is given time to properly assess the failure. Demanding constant status reports will slow down and demoralize the team.


Metrics are a tool like any other. If you tie your definition of success to a particular metric, you will find people working to maximize that metric, regardless of if that is in the best interest of the project.
