## What are the pros and cons of an incremental approach?

Advantages

After each iteration, regression testing should be conducted. During this testing, faulty elements of the software can be quickly identified because few changes are made within any single iteration.
It is generally easier to test and debug than other methods of software development because relatively smaller changes are made during each iteration. This allows for more targeted and rigorous testing of each element within the overall product.
Customer can respond to features and review the product for any needful changes.
Initial product delivery is faster and costs lower.


Disadvantages[4]

Resulting cost may exceed the cost of the organization.
As additional functionality is added to the product, problems may arise related to system architecture which were not evident in earlier prototypes.

## How do you know when you're done?

// Additional words in this section were deemed not necessary for the MVP and have been deferred to v2
When the result matches all of the requirements.

## But isn't this just lots of prototyping?

// I'll react to the market and have tentatively planned this for v3

## But isn't this just Waterfall?

// I'll react to the market and have tentatively planned this for v4
