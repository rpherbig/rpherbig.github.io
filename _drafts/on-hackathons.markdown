What can we apply to our Startup Weekends? Scheduling, Frequency?


We should encourage project-based hackathons. Why? Value...

Who covers the cost? We've done both:
* SEP pays: controls verification
* Client pays: agriculture

What if we treat the company as a project and have a hackathon whose theme is experimenting on the company? Could we see the same value as from a more typical hackathon?
