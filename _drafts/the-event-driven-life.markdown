We're all familiar with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming, but this is about letting events drive your life (or at least your workday).

I'd been pondering the abstract concept for a while, but it wasn't until someone else used the phrase "event driven life" that I had words.

* It's amazing how much of this 10 year old blog post still applies

Con: http://www.campbellcc.com/stopping-an-event-driven-life/
* "Event driven" doesn't mean that every moment has to be planned
