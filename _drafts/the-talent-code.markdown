Ignition (engagement) -> deep practice -> talent

How do we sustain ignition?

The best coaches/mentors don't need to be Great Leaders, they need to listen and observe (p 162)
	Deep learning case study (p 170)
	Learning requires engagement (p 175)

Purposefully operate at the edge of your ability
	Mistakes which you learn from make you better
	This requires ACCURATE identification of mistakes
	A clear distinction between success and failure

Repetition and quick iterations are the key
	You need fast feedback on failure
	Sound familiar?

Can we get into "deep practice" mode at work? Can work be treated as practice?
	Katas?

How do we train "slow" or "low feedback" skills?
	CRM, architecture, design
	Talk to Mumau?

Myelination is one-way (wraps, it does not unwrap), barring disease/injury or age
	This explains hard-to-break habits

This was written in 2009
	Can I fact check any of its claims?
	See "Notes on sources" at the end of the book

Do not praise for smarts
	This leads to an emphasis on APPEARING smart
	Which leads to low risk taking behavior (no operating at the edge of skill)
	This slows progress/learning

Pay attention to what your children are fascinated by
	And praise them for their effort
