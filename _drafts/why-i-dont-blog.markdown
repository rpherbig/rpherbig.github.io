That's an easy one. Because no one

Besides, who would want to read what I write? There's always someone more knowledgeable than myself on a given topic and they've probably already written a blogpost about it.

Maybe. But maybe not. There's so much going on in the world that maybe, just maybe, I've experienced something that no one else has (or at least has written about). Maybe I can help someone learn from my mistakes and experiences.



We've all had times in which we tried to find something on the Internet and came up empty. Or only found other poor souls, asking the same questions, finding the same lack of answers.

Well this is an attempt to fix all that. I'll write about whatever problems I'm solving, and I can only hope someone finds it useful.



Pragmatic reason:
* I'll get better at writing.
* I'll have to clarify my thoughts as I write, improving my understanding of each topic.
* I'll learn a new tech stack.



Why I Haven't Been Blogging

I don't have a good answer. Do you?



Make it easier for others to get started.



Blogging is all about the writing, not the presentation format.
