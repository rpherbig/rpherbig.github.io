Other things always took priority. There was always something else to do.

That's an easy one. Because no one

Besides, who would want to read what I write? There's always someone more knowledgeable than myself on a given topic and they've probably already written a blogpost about it.

Maybe. But maybe not. There's so much going on in the world that maybe, just maybe, I've experienced something that no one else has (or at least has written about). Maybe I can help someone learn from my mistakes and experiences.



We've all had times in which we tried to find something on the Internet and came up empty. Or only found other poor souls, asking the same questions, finding the same lack of answers.

Well this is an attempt to fix all that. I'll write about whatever problems I'm solving, and I can only hope someone finds it useful.



Selfish reasons:
* Get better at writing (by doing)
* Introspection: I'm forced to organize my thoughts, which leads to improved understanding of each topic
** Solidify my understanding?
** "Writing about a topic encourages you to understand it at a deeper level and helps you communicate ideas better."
* Learn a some new (or old) techs
* Establish competence
* Help others learn how better to work with me

Less selfish reasons:
* Business development for the company
** Help SEP win a project
** Convince a client I should be on their project
** Surprise old clients with our new tricks
* Help the reader out with something



Why I Haven't Been Blogging

I don't have a good answer. Do you?



Make it easier for others to get started.



Blogging is all about the writing, not the presentation format.



I'm not writing for an audience. I'm writing to organize my own thoughts. And to be better at written communication.

I've pretty much not been blogging because I think no one cares what I have to say. I think that's still accurate. But what clicked is that blogging isn't for anyone else, it's for me.
