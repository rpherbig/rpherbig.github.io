It's 2014. How hard can it be to get some text to appear on a web page? Harder than I expected since I'm using Windows.

== Install Jekyll

Follow the instructions at http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/

I had success with ruby 2.1.4, jekyll 2.5.1, wdm 0.1.0, rouge 1.7.2 (instead of pygments).

Note, during the "gem install jekyll" step, if you have jruby installed (say, for a previous project), you may very well get an error that looks like this:
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    C:/jruby/bin/jruby.exe extconf.rb
NotImplementedError: C extension support is not enabled. Pass -Xcext.enabled=tru
e to JRuby or set JRUBY_OPTS.

   (root) at C:/jruby/lib/ruby/shared/mkmf.rb:8
  require at org/jruby/RubyKernel.java:1065
   (root) at C:/jruby/lib/ruby/shared/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:1
   (root) at extconf.rb:1

What this says is that jruby does not support native C extensions.

What this means to you is that due to the quirks of the PATH environment variable, you're using jruby's gem.exe instead of ruby's. The fix is to instead install the jekyll gem via "/c/path/to/ruby/installation/bin/gem install jekyll". This is the only gem I encountered that required this - wdm, rouge, and so on were fine with jruby's gem.exe.
