A wild blog has appeared!

I've considered blogging for a while now, but somehow I never quite got around to it. I recently felt particularly motivated, so I sat down to start writing.

And promptly stopped. I had no idea what to write about. I decided to take a quick detour and get a blog up and running. It would buy me time to think of something brilliant to write. How hard could it be to set up a simple blog?

Let's start with a popular blogging tool, Jekyll. Mix in an easy hosting platform like GitHub Pages. Sprinkle in a dash of Google Domains for a personalized domain. I'll do my writing on my laptop, a Windows machine, and run Jekyll locally before publishing.

Spoiler alert: it didn't go as smoothly as I expected.

What was supposed to be a nice leisurely exercise in procrastination turned into actual effort and my first few posts. It's funny how things work out.
