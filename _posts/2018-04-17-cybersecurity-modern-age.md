## Abstract

Cybersecurity is a critical part of the software we develop. New risks and threats are emerging every day while the cost of a breach has never been greater. However, even if the software professionals understand this, communicating the risks and impact to the rest of the organization is difficult.

Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the importance of cybersecurity, an overview of how threat modeling can be used to detect our own vulnerabilities before they're exploited, and a framework for how to discuss cybersecurity with the larger organization.
