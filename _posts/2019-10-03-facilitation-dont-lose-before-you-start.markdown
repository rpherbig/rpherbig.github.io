# Facilitation: Don't Lose Before You Start

So you've been asked to facilitate a workshop for a team? Awesome, it'll be fun. Just show up at the time and place annnnnnnd you've already lost.

## Before the Workshop

> You better think (think)

> Think about what you're trying to do

-- Aretha Franklin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aretha_Franklin)

Someone had to feel strongly enough about this to put a multi-hour block of time on the team's calendar. This is the First Stakeholder. Start with them. You need to understand what they want out of this workshop. What outcomes will make them call this a success?

Hopefully that first stakeholder has conveyed their vision of success to the team. Validate that assumption. Talk to the rest of the team. Understand what they want to get out of the workshop. It's better to discover any differences ahead of time rather than in the workshop itself.

Take advantage of those conversations with the team members to hear their perspectives, their pains, their goals for the workshop. Is it scheduled at the same time as their kid's play at school but they're forced to attend? That's good to know. Find out who on the team is quiet, who interrupts, who isn't afraid to speak their mind.

Ask if the team has established any norms (especially around communication styles) or shared vocabulary. If they don't, be prepared to suggest some at the workshop.

If necessary, circle back with the First Stakeholder. Help them understand what the team's perspective is. Help them understand their role in the workshop: getting the right people in the room, taking a step back, and letting them be awesome.

Pick the right time of day. If you have a team of night-owls, don't expect a lot of dazzling creativity at 8am. If the team gets into the office before 8am, don't plan the meeting for the late afternoon. If the workshop is early, provide breakfast. If it's around lunchtime, provide lunch.

Daniel Pink (https://www.danpink.com/) wrote a book called "When" (https://www.amazon.com/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing/dp/0735210624) which goes into more depth on the topic of _chronobiology_. If you can, plan activities to occur at the appropriate time of day to correspond with type of thinking involved. Here's a quick summary (https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/take-more-breaks-4-other-facts-about-author-daniel-pinks-scientific-secrets-perfect-timing).

## Planning the Workshop

### Introduction

The first part of any workshop should be to remind the team **why** they're here. Our goal here is to inspire the group. Consider having the First Stakeholder do this part. They must provide a vision of success. This sets the tone for the rest of the workshop and is foundational.

Next is a good time to revisit team norms. Suggest some basic ones if needed. Use that as the foundation to set expectations with the entire group. Some suggestions:

* Assume the best in each other (https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html)
* Don't interrupt the person talking (https://www.belbin.com/resources/blogs/belbin-and-project-aristotle-everything-you-need-to-know/)
* Everyone's contributions are valuable (https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)
* The first idea is rarely the best idea (https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/need-to-know/offbeat/scientific-reason-first-idea-rarely-best-one/)

### Vary Up the Type of Activities

There are three types of activities in most workshops:

* Mechanical or Administrative - the most straightforward. Example: "Draw a diagram of the system as it is today."
* Emotional or Creative - creative work like brainstorming or how does something make you feel? Example: "What pains have you felt when using the system?" or "What would the ideal system look like?"
* Intellectual or Analytical - sometimes requires focused attention; problem solving. Example: "What steps do we need to take to mitigate the problems in the system?"

Start with a mechanical activity to warm up. Don't have too many activities of the same type in a row.

### Know Your Audience

As the facilitator, your audience is the team you'll be working with in the workshop. Use what you learned from talking to people before the workshop to shape your approach and the activities.

For example, if there are team members who are naturally quiet or aren't comfortable speaking up, most activities can be adjusted to help them out. A typical brainstorming activity could start with 5 minutes of silent brainstorming. That same change would help out team members who aren't comfortable thinking out loud or extemporaneously.

### Pick the Right Activities

Something about how this article isn't about specific activities. Pick activities that accomplish the team's goals.

### Take Breaks

About every hour. Each activity should either be done within an hour or be able to be paused for a few minutes at the one hour mark. Read the attitude in the room and go longer or shorter as needed.

### Wrap Up

Compare where you are with the original goals. End with concrete action items. Assign a person to each one. Set the team up to succeed.

## After the Workshop

How involved you are in the after phase varies. In my experience, the best results come from the team committing and the facilitator offering to be available for advice, suggestions, and help. You're the chicken, not the pig (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig).

Improvise, adapt, and overcome.

It's going to be fun.
