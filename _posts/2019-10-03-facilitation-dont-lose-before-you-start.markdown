# Facilitation: Don't Lose Before You Start

So you want to facilitate a workshop for a team? Maybe you're external to the team and have been asked to help by facilitating. Awesome, it'll be fun. Just show up at the time and place annnnnnnd you've already lost.

> You better think (think)

> Think about what you're trying to do

## Ask The Right Question

The workshop should be answering a question. That gives all of the participants a clear vision of what they're trying to achieve. "What is preventing the team from moving faster?" is a very different workshop than "How do we improve our deployment process?" which is very different from "How do we fully automate our deployment process?"

## Get to Know Your Stakeholders

If one person felt strongly enough about this to put a multi-hour block of time on the team's calendar, that's your First Stakeholder. Start with them. You need to understand what they want out of this workshop. What outcomes will make them call this a success? Help them understand their role in the workshop: getting the right people in the room, taking a step back, and letting the team be awesome. If there is no such person, that's fine too.

Hopefully the First Stakeholder has conveyed their vision of success to the team. Validate that assumption. Talk to the rest of the team. Understand what they want to get out of the workshop. It's better to discover any differences ahead of time rather than in the workshop itself.

Take advantage of those conversations with the team members to hear their perspectives, their pains, their goals for the workshop. Is it scheduled at the same time as their kid's play at school but they're forced to attend? That's good to know. Find out who on the team is quiet, who interrupts, who isn't afraid to speak their mind. Find out who on the team likes the status quo and [doesn't feel change is necessary](https://hbr.org/2013/07/hidden-danger-of-being-risk-averse).

If what you're learning isn't making sense, or there are incompatible goals, if some constraints can't possibly be met, etc. then have a second sit-down with the First Stakeholder or with the team as a whole. Help them understand what you've learned. The workshop simply won't be successful as framed - the direction needs to change. Be supportive and advocate for the team and the individuals you've talked to.

## Learn the Team's Communication Style

Ask if the team has established any norms (especially around communication styles) or shared vocabulary. You as facilitator need to be aware of these and use them in the workshop. If they don't, be prepared to suggest some at the workshop. A good baseline could include:

* [Assume the best in each other](https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html)
* [Don't interrupt the person talking](https://www.belbin.com/resources/blogs/belbin-and-project-aristotle-everything-you-need-to-know/)
* [Everyone's contributions are valuable](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)
* [The first idea is rarely the best idea](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/need-to-know/offbeat/scientific-reason-first-idea-rarely-best-one/)
* [Promote _healthy_ conflict](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions)

## Pick the Right Time of Day

It matters. If you have a team of night-owls, don't expect a lot of dazzling creativity at 8am. If the team gets into the office before 8am, don't plan the meeting for the late afternoon. If the workshop is early, provide breakfast. If it's around lunchtime, provide lunch.

[Daniel Pink](https://www.danpink.com/) wrote [a book called "When"](https://www.amazon.com/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing/dp/0735210624) which goes into more depth on the topic of _chronobiology_. If you can, plan activities to occur at the appropriate time of day to correspond with type of thinking involved. [Here's a quick summary](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/take-more-breaks-4-other-facts-about-author-daniel-pinks-scientific-secrets-perfect-timing) if you want to learn more.

Of course, sometimes the time is out of our control. Don't sweat what you don't control, just move on and make the best of it.

## Planning the Workshop Activities

### Kick It Off

The first part of any workshop should be to remind the team **why** they're here. Our goal here is to inspire the group. Consider having the First Stakeholder do this part. They must provide a vision of success. This sets the tone for the rest of the workshop and is foundational. It's also a good time to talk about team norms around communication. Suggest some basic ones if needed. Use that as the foundation to set expectations with the team.

### Pick the Right Activities

If I tried to talk about specific activities this would turn into a book. And it turns out Esther Derby and Diana Larsen already wrote a great book on this topic: [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649). Think of it as a cookbook with recipes for activities. The activities are broadly broken up into three categories: gathering data, generating insights, and deciding what to do. There's a description of each activity and a quick note about what the team should expect to get out of it.

Every activity should get the team closer one step closer to accomplishing its goal.

### Vary Up the Type of Activities

There are three types of activities in most workshops:

* Mechanical or Administrative - the most straightforward. Example: "Draw a diagram of the system as it is today."
* Emotional or Creative - creative work like brainstorming or how does something make you feel? Example: "What pains have you felt when using the system?" or "What would the ideal system look like?"
* Intellectual or Analytical - sometimes requires focused attention; problem solving. Example: "What steps do we need to take to mitigate the problems in the system?"

In general, I would start the workshop with an emotional activity. Bonding or trust building helps to get people comfortable speaking with each other. On the other hand, if the team needs to wake up (say they're night owls at a morning workshop), I suggest starting with a mechanical activity to warm up.

Don't have too many activities of the same type in a row.

### Know Your Audience

As the facilitator, your audience is the team you'll be working with in the workshop. Use what you learned from talking to people before the workshop to shape your approach and the activities.

For example, if there are team members who are naturally quiet or aren't comfortable speaking up, most activities can be adjusted to help them out. A typical brainstorming activity could start with 5 minutes of silent brainstorming. That same change would help out team members who aren't comfortable thinking out loud or extemporaneously.

### Plan to Take Breaks

About every hour. Each activity should either be done within an hour or be able to be paused for a few minutes at the one hour mark. Read the attitude in the room and go longer or shorter as needed.

### Pace Yourself

Estimate time for each activity (range, not single point). Know what you want to do if it goes longer or shorter.

## End With Action Items

Compare where you are with the original goals. End with concrete action items. Assign a person to each one. Set the team up to succeed.

## After the Workshop

How involved you are in the 'after' phase varies. In my experience, the best results come from the team committing and the facilitator offering to be available for advice, suggestions, and help. [You're the chicken, not the pig.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig)

## Key Takeaways

Do you need to consider everything I mentioned here? Not necessarily - be agile and lean and pragmatic. Spend more or less time preparing based on the importance of the meeting and the expected return of that prep time.

Improvise, adapt, and overcome.

It's going to be fun.
