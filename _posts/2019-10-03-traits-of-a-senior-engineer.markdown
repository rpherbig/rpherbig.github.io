## What Does It Mean to be a Senior Engineer?

As a team lead, I coach and mentor many junior engineers. One topic that always comes up is "What does it mean to be a 
engineer?" That's easy, you just... have a four-year degree from an accredited college? Work for 10 years and don't get fired? Learn 3 front-end technologies? Check some boxes on a promotion form?

Defining what it means to be a Senior Engineer is an impossible task. If you talk to 10 people you'll get 11 different opinions. It's tempting to reduce an undefinable thing to ["I know it when I see it"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it), but that makes it dangerously easy to inject bias. To that end, I want to try and describe the behaviors, characteristics, and traits I have observed in excellent Senior engineers.

## Comfortable With Uncertainty

The best Senior engineers strike a fascinating balance between being utterly confident that they can solve any problem, and a lack of confidence that they already know the best way to solve it. It's the difference between being aware of the [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) versus actively trying to mitigate it.

This comfort with uncertainty is great when investigating unknowns, which is often where the most difficult problem lie, along with the potential for the greatest wins. Often investigative efforts or tasks are poorly-defined and there are many distinct paths to pursue. How long should we investigate one option before pivoting to another? Too little time means we missed some easy gains. Too much time and it's the opposite - the cost of an incremental gain is too high. 

## Curiosity Mindset

I've struggled with how to describe this concept. "Curiosity mindset" resonates with some people; others prefer "humility" or "egolessness". It means to be aware of your assumptions and biases. More importantly, to be aware that they need to be questioned.

When a junior engineer doesn't believe something you say, don't get defensive. This isn't an opportunity to prove them wrong, it's an opportunity to understand why they have a belief and show them another option. Most importantly of all, keep in mind that it's an opportunity for you to learn something too.

I can't stress that last point enough. [Being right is not enough](https://royrapoport.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-three.html).

## Growing Those Around Them

As a team lead or Senior engineer, people often come to us for help. When that happens, it's not enough to simply help them solve the problem; rather we should be thinking "How do I teach them to solve this problem the next time it happens?" The principle here is that [investing in your team yields amazing returns](https://agilevelocity.com/agile-training/training-return-investment/). And for the pragmatic among us, training up our team means they can handle more problems while we're on vacation - without calling us.

## What about technical skills?

Sure, strong technical skills are important. But they're also assumed by the point we're even talking about Senior engineer. Software development is [very much a social endeavor](https://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/11/programming-is-a-social-endeavor.html).
