## Abstract

Many of our clients have domain experts who are identifying interesting properties in large sets of data. The experts are often systems or mechanical or electrical engineers who are not statisticians, data scientists, or programmers. Rather than hire one of those and teach them the domain, these clients want their existing experts to leverage AI techniques to better perform the tasks they are already doing.

There are many AI libraries available in Python, but they are designed to be used by programmers. We have been building some tools in Python to lower the barrier to entry for those existing libraries. We detect common errors early, make evaluation of learner performance easy, and visualization of learner behavior and the underlying data more accessible.

We'll talk about what drove these decisions and walk through a simple example of using this tool on a readily-available dataset.
