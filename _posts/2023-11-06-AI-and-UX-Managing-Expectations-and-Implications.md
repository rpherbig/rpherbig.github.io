## Abstract

The recent advances in Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) have caused many people to ask how AI will impact their work. There will be changes to how we work, for better or worse. There is a lot of excitement around the "better" and a lot of fear around the "worse," and often both are exaggerated.

Jordan and Robert are two expert AI practitioners working at a software product design consultancy. Come join the conversation with them about what’s happening, what’s possible, what’s real, and what’s not... where UX and AI intersect.
