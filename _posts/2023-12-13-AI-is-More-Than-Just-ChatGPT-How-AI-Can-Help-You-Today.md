## Abstract

AI has captured the attention of the world—for better or worse. Hype, noise, and fear are dominating the headlines, with a huge focus on ChatGPT and its competitors. 

Lost in the noise is the big picture: AI has been around for decades and already impacts our everyday lives.

In this session, we'll re-center the AI discussion for business:

* demystify ChatGPT functions and limitations, along with the rest of the AI landscape
* outline business needs addressed by AI and provide real-life examples
* discuss the current state of AI, what’s working well, and what to look out for
