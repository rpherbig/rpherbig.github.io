I live in Carmel, Indiana with my wonderful wife, our two sons, and our two dogs.

I went to school at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/) and graduated with my Bachelors of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science and Software Engineering.

I'm a Lead Software Engineer at [Software Engineering Professionals](http://www.sep.com/). In my 10 years in the software industry I've worked on embedded, desktop, web, and mobile products; ranging in size from small apps to enterprise systems. I've worked in a variety of markets including aerospace, medical, agriculture, construction, and secure communication.

I'm passionate about leading teams that can deliver products users love.

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:robert@rpherbig.com) - I'd love to hear from you and I welcome any feedback.
