I live in Indiana with my wonderful wife, son, and our two dogs. I'm a software engineer at [Software Engineering Professionals](http://www.sep.com). I love what I do, and do what I love.

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:robert@rpherbig.com) - I'd love to hear from you and I welcome any feedback on the site.
