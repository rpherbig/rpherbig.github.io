I live in Carmel, Indiana with my wonderful wife, our two sons, and our two dogs.

I've worked in the software industry for 10 years now. I've worked on embedded, desktop, and web. From small apps to enterprise systems. In the aerospace, medical, agriculture, construction, and radio encryption markets.

I'm a Lead Software Engineer at [Software Engineering Professionals](http://www.sep.com/). I went to school at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/) and graduated with my Bachelors of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science and Software Engineering.

I'm passionate about leading teams to build products that users love.

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:robert@rpherbig.com) - I'd love to hear from you and I welcome any feedback.
